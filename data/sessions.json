      "content": " Hello! I'd be happy to help with your math questions. Let's break down the problem you've presented into smaller steps.\n\n1) First, let's find the initial kinetic energy (Ki) of the snowball given its mass (m = 1.5 kg) and initial speed (v = 20 m/s). Using the formula Kinetic Energy (KE) = 1/2 * m * v^2, we get Ki = 300 Joules.\n\n2) Since there are only conservative forces involved (gravity), we know that mechanical energy is conserved. This means the initial mechanical energy (Ki + Ui) equals the final mechanical energy (Kf + Uf). We already have the initial kinetic energy, and since the snowball started at rest, the initial potential energy Ui = 0. To find the final potential energy Uf, we subtract the final kinetic energy Kf from the initial kinetic energy Ki, giving us Uf = 300 J - 206 J = 94 J.\n\n3) Using the formula for gravitational potential energy (Ugrav = m * g * y, where g is the acceleration due to gravity), we can find the maximum height h of the snowball when its potential energy is Uf: h = Uf / (m * g). Plugging in our values, we get h = 94 J / (1.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) = 6.38 meters.\n\n4) For the pendulum problem, you're asked to find the speed of the stone at the lowest point and the compression required for a direct hit. Since I don't have all the necessary information (like the spring constant k or the mass of the marble), I can't solve this problem fully. However, if you provide those details, I can help you continue solving it!\n\n5) Lastly, regarding the light bulb question, it calculates the number of 60W bulbs that could be lit with the total energy consumption rate of Niagara Falls. They find that 9.8 million 60W bulbs could be lit if all the energy went to the bulbs.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanations."

When setting up \nour parentheses, we have to think about how o ur First terms can multiply \ntogether to give us 2.  The only way to do this is by 2x and x.  \nHere, it really becomes a puzzle.

Because of the 2 in front of the x2, we \nknow that double  one of these numbers plus the other must give us -7.  \nLuckily 4 has only two sets of factors: 1 & 4 and 2 & 2.  One of these must \nbe negative and one positive, since the 4 is negative.  If you double -4, you \nget -8.  If you add 1 to -8, you get -7, which is exactly what we are looking \nfor.  Since the 4 must  be multiplied by the 2 in the first set of parentheses, \nit has to go in the other set of parenthesis.  \nThen solve both for 0 to find our solutions.
