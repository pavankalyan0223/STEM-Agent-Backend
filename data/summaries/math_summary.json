    "summary": " **Problem Solving with Order of Operations (PEMDAS)**\n\nThe text discusses problem solving using the order of operations (PEMDAS), which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule helps in properly solving mathematical expressions.\n\n**Example 1:** Simplifying an expression with parentheses and subtraction:\n-2[3 - (-2)(6)]\n\n1. Inside the parenthesis, apply PEMDAS: first subtract and then multiply: `3 - (-12) = 3 + 12 = 15`\n2. Now multiply the result by -2: `-2 * 15 = -30`\n\n**Example 2:** Simplifying an expression with multiple terms, like terms, and exponents:\nx\u00b2 + 10x \u2013 6 \u2013 5x + 4\n\n1. Identify terms that contain the same variable (x) and combine them:\n   - x\u00b2: no other terms contain x\u00b2, so it remains as is\n   - 10x and -5x are like terms, so add their coefficients together: 10 + (-5) = 5; write 5x\n   - -6 and 4 combine to give -2\n2. Combine the resulting terms: x\u00b2 + 5x \u2013 2\n\n**Your Turn:** Simplify an expression with parentheses, subtraction, and multiplication:\n2x + 4 [2 \u2013(5x \u2013 3)]\n\n1. Inside the parenthesis, apply PEMDAS: first subtract and then multiply: `2 - (5x - 3) = 2 + 3 - 5x`\n2. Combine terms: 2x + 4(2 + 3 - 5x)\n3. Distribute the multiplication: 2x + 8 - 10x + 4\n4. Combine like terms: -8x + 12\n\n**Additional Example:** Simplifying an expression with parentheses, subtraction, multiplication, and exponents:\n(-4)\u00b2 + 2[12 + (3 -5)]\n\n1. Inside the parenthesis, apply PEMDAS: first subtract and then add: `3 - 5 = -2`\n2. Now add: `12 + (-2) = 10`\n3. Square (-4): `(-4)\u00b2 = 16`\n4. Combine the results: 16 + 2[10]\n5. Distribute the multiplication: 16 + 20\n6. Add the terms: 36\n\nIn all examples, remember to follow PEMDAS when solving expressions with multiple operations."

    "summary": " **Explanation of Exponents and Simplifying Expressions**\n\n1. Exponents\n   - Exponents indicate repeated multiplications. For example, (4^2) means 4 multiplied by itself twice, resulting in 16. It's essential to follow the order of operations PEMDAS when dealing with exponents, especially when using a calculator. If you input -4^2, the calculator will perform the exponent first and then change the sign, giving -16. However, the correct answer is 16 after completing multiplication and addition.\n\n2. Simplifying Expressions\n   - The given expression is (5a^2 \u2013 3a +1) \u2013 (2a^2 \u2013 4a + 6).\n   - To simplify, distribute the negative sign in the second parenthesis to every term.\n   - This results in 5a^2 \u2013 3a +1 \u2013 2a^2 + 4a \u2013 6.\n   - Combine like terms to get 3a^2 + a - 5.\n\n**Solving Equations**\n\n- An equation is a mathematical statement that equates two expressions. The goal of solving equations is to isolate the variable, typically denoted as x, on one side of the equation.\n- To solve an equation, follow the reverse order of operations (PEMDAS) and \"undo\" what was done initially to the problem. This involves looking for addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division, then exponents, and parentheses.\n- The crucial rule when solving an equation is that the negative sign affects every term it's attached to within the parenthesis, not just the first term."

    "summary": " **Equation Solving Guide**\n\nHere is a guide on how to solve equations using the PEMDAS rule and some examples:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve any problems inside parentheses first.\n   - Example: (x + 4) * 3 = 12\n     Solved as: x + 4 = 4, then x = 0\n\n2. **Exponents**: Solve exponential expressions next.\n   - Example: 2^(x + 2) = 8\n     Solved as: 2^(x + 2) = 2^3, then x + 2 = 3, then x = 1\n\n3. **Multiplication and Division (from left to right)**: Solve multiplication and division problems from left to right.\n   - Example: 5 * (x - 1) = -3\n     Solved as: 5 * x - 5 = -3, then x = 1/2\n\n4. **Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)**: Solve addition and subtraction problems from left to right.\n   - Example: x + 9 = -6\n     Solved as: x + 9 - 9 = -6, then x = -15\n   - Example: 5x - 7 = 2\n     Solved as: 5x - 7 + 7 = 2 + 7, then x = 9/5\n\n**Problem-Solving Strategy**\n\nThe main goal when solving an equation is to isolate the variable on one side of the equal sign. To do this, you need to \"undo\" what was done to the problem initially using PEMDAS rules in reverse order (BACKWARDS) and move one thing at a time to leave the term with the variable until the end.\n\n- When terms are added or subtracted, add or subtract them from both sides of the equal sign.\n  - Example: 7(x + 4) = 6x + 24\n    Solved as: 7x + 28 = 6x + 24, then 7x - 6x = 28 - 24, then x = -4"

    "summary": " **Inequalities Manipulation**\n\n1. Basic Steps for Solving Inequalities:\n   - Do not perform the operation on both sides of the inequality sign without first multiplying or dividing both sides by the same non-zero number.\n   - When multiplying (or dividing) by a negative number, flip the sign of the inequality.\n\n2. Example: Given `1/4 * x < 2`, multiply both sides by 4 to get `x < 8`.\n   If given `-1/4 * x < 2`, multiply both sides by -4 to get `x > 2`.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification**\n   - After solving the inequality, substitute the values to check the answer. For example, if we found that `x > 2`, checking with `x = 1` would result in a true statement (since 1 > 2 is false).\n\n4. **Problem Solving Example**\n   - Given: `4x + 2 > 10`\n     Solve for x: `4x > 10 - 2`, then divide both sides by 4 to get `x > 2`.\n\n5. **Absolute Values**\n   - The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line, and is always positive. For example, `|5| = 5` and `|-7| = 7`.\n\n6. **Solving Absolute Value Equations**\n   - When solving absolute value equations, consider that the number inside could have been negative before applying the absolute value. This leads to two solutions for the equation.\n\n7. Example: Given `|x + 2| = 3`, we get `x + 2 = 3` and `x + 2 = -3`. Solving gives us `x = 1` and `x = -5`.\n\n8. **Example: Solving an inequality with absolute values**\n   - Given: `-2(x \u2013 5) < 10`\n     Solve for x: `-2(x - 5) > -10`, then divide both sides by -2 to get `x - 5 < 5`. Adding 5 to both sides gives us `x > 0`."
